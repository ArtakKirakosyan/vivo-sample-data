##VIVO sample data

June 3, 2014

This repository contains sample data that can be loaded into the [VIVO](http://vivoweb.org/) Semantic Web application.

This is intended to be a basic sample set of data that can be loaded into a fresh VIVO instance.  See the [VIVO Vagrant](https://github.com/lawlesst/vivo-vagrant) and [background information](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/VIVO/Learning+about+VIVO) if you are interested in getting started with VIVO.

The data is mapped to the [VIVO ISF](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/VIVO/VIVO-ISF+Ontology) ontology.  The VIVO ISF was introduced in VIVO version 1.6.
