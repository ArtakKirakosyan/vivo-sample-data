This repository contains sample data that can be loaded into the [VIVO](http://vivoweb.org/) Semantic Web application.

This is intended to make it easy to load a fresh VIVO instance with test data.  See the [VIVO Vagrant](https://github.com/lawlesst/vivo-vagrant) and [background information](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/VIVO/Learning+about+VIVO) if you are interested in getting started with VIVO.

The data is modeled with the [VIVO ISF](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/VIVO/VIVO-ISF+Ontology) ontology in mind.  The VIVO ISF was introduced in VIVO version 1.6.
